Subject: Literature Review Critique

As requested, this is my critique of Josh Coleman's literature review entitled "Smoking's Effect on Osteoarthritis: A Benefit or Detriment?". Since the aim of this critique is to provide helpful feedback to the author, the rest of this memo will be addressed to Josh Coleman. The table below represents my evaluation of the literature review according to the grading rubric given on LearningSuite. I will address each item separately.

Format and Appearance: 50/55
Subject Matter: 100/115
Style and Mechanics: 50/80
TOTAL: 200/250

FORMAT AND APPEARANCE

The first thing I noticed was the font choice. Calibri is the default font on the current version of Microsoft Word. Calibri is a humanist sans-serif typeface. This means that there is subtle variation in letter thickness, similar to the stroke thickness when writing with a fountain pen. This gives the font a human touch and is supposed to make the font feel feel warm and friendly. However, Calibri is less readable than serif fonts like Times New Roman. Most graphic designers consider humanist sans-serif typefaces to be casual and unprofessional. A literature review would be dressed up better by using different fonts. I recommend using Arial Narrow for titles and subtitles and Times New Roman for body text. Otherwise, stick to Times New Roman.

The title on page 1 uses two different sizes of font. The progressively smaller fonts leads the eye in an awkward direction toward the "Overall Effect" section. Also, there are white space pockets above the title and between the "Introduction" section and the "Overall Effect" section. See image for details. Since you already have a title page, I recommend removing the title from page 1 and extending the columns to fill the page. This should solve the white space problem.

Visually, the subheadings are ok. Consider changing them from underlined to italics for better contrast with the main headings.

Figures A, B, and C create some visual interest on the page. However, Figure D is too big to be set in text. Since it contains lots of information, it deserves its own page.

SUBJECT MATTER

The review has a significant amount of "significant" results. By significant amount, I mean that the word "significant" (or some variation of it) occurs 8 times in the first 4 pages of the literature review. That's 2 uses per page. For example, on page 2, "Comparatively, non-smokers saw a significantly greater reduction of their bone marrow lesions [9]. This relationship is significant when it is considered that bone marrow lesions have been associated with cartilage loss [11]." This leaves me asking by how much? and compared to what? The evidence in the sources hides behind vague words like "significant" and "overwhelmingly". Instead, find facts or statistics inside the sources and share those with the reader. Put figures into context by comparing them to other relevant figures. Non-smokers have 23% fewer bone marrow lesions than do their smoking counterparts. This sounds better than having significantly fewer lesions.

The paper lacks detail and depth. I'm consistently want more information. Figures A, B, and C are abstract and don't tell me anything that couldn't be said in a sentence. Figure A: Smoking may cause a persistence of bone marrow lesions which are linked to decreased cartilage volume---one of the effects of osteoarthritis. Using specific numbers, percentages, or other relevant data would improve the effectiveness of the Figures.

The relationship between smoking and osteoarthritis is a great topic and seems filled with contradictions. There is plenty of source material.

STYLE AND MECHANICS

There are lots of unnecessary words in the literature review. Many of these words are adverbs and adjectives that take away from the power of the sentences. Passive voice makes this problem worse. For example, on the bottom of page 2, "However, research on this subject has proven to be much more complex and contradictory." Make this statement more powerful by changing "has proven" to "proves" and removing "much more". However, research on this subject proves to be complex and contradictory. The sentence now does more with less.

Sometimes, the subject and the verb are separated by a clause. Again on page 2, "Smoking, with its vastly negative impact on bone, causes a decrease in a person's bone mineral density [10]." Removing the clause brings out the active voice. Smoking causes a decrease in bone mineral density or Smoking decreases bone mineral density. That's a stronger statement.

	journal={BMC bioinformatics},
	volume={10},
	number={1},
	pages={92},
	abstract={A central goal of experimental studies in systems biology is to identify meaningful markers that are hidden within a diffuse background of data originating from large-scale analytical intensity measurements as obtained from metabolomic experiments. Intensity-based clustering is an unsupervised approach to the identification of metabolic markers based on the grouping of similar intensity profiles. A major problem of this basic approach is that in general there is no prior information about an adequate number of biologically relevant clusters. We present the tool MarVis (Marker Visualization) for data mining on intensity-based profiles using one-dimensional self-organizing maps (1D-SOMs). MarVis can import and export customizable CSV (Comma Separated Values) files and provides aggregation and normalization routines for preprocessing of intensity profiles that contain repeated measurements for a number of different experimental conditions. Robust clustering is then achieved by training of an 1D-SOM model, which introduces a similarity-based ordering of the intensity profiles. The ordering allows a convenient visualization of the intensity variations within the data and facilitates an interactive aggregation of clusters into larger blocks. The intensity-based visualization is combined with the presentation of additional data attributes, which can further support the analysis of experimental data. MarVis is a user-friendly and interactive tool for exploration of complex pattern variation in a large set of experimental intensity profiles. The application of 1D-SOMs gives a convenient overview on relevant profiles and groups of profiles. The specialized visualization effectively supports researchers in analyzing a large number of putative clusters, even though the true number of biologically meaningful groups is unknown. Although MarVis has been developed for the analysis of metabolomic data, the tool may be applied to gene expression data as well.},

Many good, generally applicable colormaps are proposed as direct replacements for the rainbow. However, there are still many who choose rainbows and like them. Would a colormap with perfect luminance and the chromaticity of a rainbow ﬁnd a wider audience? This was our moti- vation in studying the range of chromatic eﬀects arising from luminance corrections. Consequently we developed a framework for adjusting col- ormaps to various degrees which produces favorable results on a wide range of colormaps. In this work we will detail this framework and demon- strate its eﬀectiveness on several colormaps.},

Research approach was to determine the level of usefulness of particular characteristics of visual variables such as selective, associative, quantitative and order. An attempt was made to provide an overview of static visual variables and to describe the AR system which is a new paradigm of the user interface. Changing the approach to the presentation of point objects is caused by applying diﬀe- rent perspective in the observation of objects (egocentric view) than it is done on traditional analogue maps (geocentric view).  Presented topics will refer to the fast-developing ﬁeld of cartography, namely mobile cartography.

	abstract={Heart disease is the number one killer in the United States, and finding indicators of the disease at an early stage is critical for treatment and prevention. In this paper we evaluate visualization techniques that enable the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. A key physical quantity of medical interest is endothelial shear stress (ESS). Low ESS has been associated with sites of lesion formation and rapid progression of disease in the coronary arteries. Having effective visualizations of a patient's ESS data is vital for the quick and thorough non-invasive evaluation by a cardiologist. We present a task taxonomy for hemodynamics based on a formative user study with domain experts. Based on the results of this study we developed HemoVis, an interactive visualization application for heart disease diagnosis that uses a novel 2D tree diagram representation of coronary artery trees. We present the results of a formal quantitative user study with domain experts that evaluates the effect of 2D versus 3D artery representations and of color maps on identifying regions of low ESS. We show statistically significant results demonstrating that our 2D visualizations are more accurate and efficient than 3D representations, and that a perceptually appropriate color map leads to fewer diagnostic mistakes than a rainbow color map.},

	abstract={Multidimensional scaling is a must‐have tool for visual data miners, projecting multidimensional data onto a two‐dimensional plane. However, what we see is not necessarily what we think about. In many cases, end‐users do not take care of scaling the projection space with respect to the multidimensional space. Anyway, when using non‐linear mappings, scaling is not even possible. Yet, without scaling geometrical structures which might appear do not make more sense than considering a random map. Without scaling, we shall not make inference from the display back to the multidimensional space. No clusters, no trends, no outliers, there is nothing to infer without first quantifying the mapping quality. Several methods to qualify mappings have been devised. Here, we propose CheckViz, a new method belonging to the framework of Verity Visualization. We define a two‐dimensional perceptually uniform colour coding which allows visualizing tears and false neighbourhoods, the two elementary and complementary types of geometrical mapping distortions, straight onto the map at the location where they occur. As examples shall demonstrate, this visualization method is essential to help users make sense out of the mappings and to prevent them from over interpretations. It could be applied to check other mappings as well.},

	abstract={We describe a technique for choosing multiple colours for use during data visualization. Our goal is a systematic method for maximizing the total number of colours available for use, while still allowing an observer to rapidly and accurately search a display for any one of the given colours. Previous research suggests that we need to consider three separate effects during colour selection: colour distance, linear separation, and colour category. We describe a simple method for measuring and controlling all of these effects. Our method was tested by performing a set of target identification studies; we analysed the ability of thirty eight observers to find a colour target in displays that contained differently coloured background elements. Results showed our method can be used to select a group of colours that will provide good differentiation between data elements during data visualization.},

Stage 1 considers the communication of colour information by numbers. The second stage is colour difference evaluation. While the CIE system has been successfully applied for over 80 years, it can only be used under quite limited viewing conditions, e.g.,  daylight  illuminant,  high  luminance  level,  and  some  standardised  view- ing/illuminating geometries. However, with recent demands on crossmedia colour reproduction, e.g., to match the appearance of a colour or an image on a display to that on hard copy paper, conventional colorimetry is becoming insufﬁcient. It requires a colour appearance model capable of predicting colour appearance across a wide range of viewing conditions so that colour appearance modelling becomes the third stage of colorimetry. Some call this as advanced colorimetry. This chapter will focused on the recent developments based on CIECAM02.},

	abstract={An experiment shows that maps can be designed to accommodate the approximately 4 percent of the population with red-green color-vision impairments. The experiment used seven pairs of maps with seven different color schemes to determine the effects of color selection on the map-reading ability of people with impaired or normal color vision. One rendition in each pair had colors that were potentially confusing to people with red-green impairments; the other had colors selected specifically to accommodate this group. On the set with potentially confusing colors, people with red-green impairments were less accurate and took longer to respond than those with normal color vision. They were just as accurate as those with normal color vision on the set with accommodating colors but continued to have longer reaction times. Logit analysis of accuracy confirmed the interaction between vision group (normal, impaired) and rendition of the map (confusing, accommodating) and indicated that performance differed from one color scheme to another. An analysis of variance of reaction times on legend-matching questions yielded similar results for the same variables. A second part of the test asked participants to choose from each pair (confusing, accommodating) of the renditions the map that was easier or better to use. Those with red-green impairments overwhelmingly chose the accommodating renditions; those with normal color vision did not show a clear preference for one rendition over the other.},

	abstract={Use of color for representing health data on maps raises many unanswered questions. This research addresses questions about which colors allow accurate map reading and which colors map users prefer. Through the combination of a review of previous color research and an experiment designed to test specific combinations of colors on maps, criteria were established and evaluated for selecting colors for choropleth maps of mortality data. The color-selection criteria provide pairs of hues for diverging schemes that avoid naming and colorblind confusions. We also tested sequential and spectral schemes. Our results show that color is worth the extra effort and expense it adds to map making because it permits greater accuracy in map reading. In addition, people prefer color maps over monochrome maps. Interestingly, scheme preference is affected by levels of clustering within mapped distributions. In this research, people preferred spectral and purple/green hue combinations. Contrary to our expectations, spectral schemes are effective if designed to include diverging lightness steps suited to the logical structure of mapped data. Diverging schemes produce better rate retrievals than both spectral and sequential schemes, however. In addition, diverging schemes place better emphasis on map clusters than sequential schemes. Thus map effectiveness is improved by use of diverging schemes. Our interdisciplinary research connects geographers with epidemiologists through concern about map symbolization and map reading, strengthening a significant area of collaboration. Providing guidelines that improve the design of customized color schemes will assist map makers in all disciplines in gaining insights about their data.},

Recent research, however, has shown that spectral schemes are preferred and are interpreted accurately when used as multi-hue renditions of diverging schemes. Both spectral and diverging schemes can emphasize a critical point within a data range with light colors and emphasize both high and low extremes of the data with dark colors. Although spectral schemes include multiple saturated hues, they can be designed to accommodate map reading by people with red-green impaired color vision by skipping over the yellow-greens in the spectral sequence. Cartographers should encourage use of spectral color schemes for depicting diverging quantitative data, rather than insisting that these schemes should not be used.},

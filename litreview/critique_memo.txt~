Subject: Literature Review Critique

As requested, this is my critique of Josh Coleman's literature review
entitled "Smoking's Effect on Osteoarthritis: A Benefit or Detriment?". The
table below represents my evaluation of the literature
review according to the grading rubric given on LearningSuite. The rest of
this document will address each item mentioned in the table.

Format and Appearance: 45/55
Subject Matter: 100/115
Style and Mechanics: 40/80

FORMAT AND APPEARANCE

The first thing I noticed was the font choice. Josh chose to use Calibri, the
default font on the current version of Microsoft Word. Calibri is a humanist
sans-serif typeface. The subtle variation in letter thickness gives the font a
human touch and makes it feel warm and friendly. However, humanist sans-serif
fonts are dated and not well liked among professional graphic designers.
Despite being legible, Calibri is less readable than other
serif fonts. Times New Roman was mentioned as a requirement after the literature review was
printed so I did not penalize the review based on that requirement. To the
design community and others, a default font on a program as widely used as
Microsoft Word is perceived to be a sign of laziness and apathy.

if you can keep your head when all about you
are losing theirs and blaming it on you
if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you
but make allowance for their doubting too
if you can wait and not be tired by waiting
or being lied about dont deal in lies
or being hated dont give way to hating
and yet dont look too good nor talk too wise
if you can dream and not make dreams your master
if you can think and not make thoughts your aim
if you can meet with triumph and disaster
and treat those two impostors just the same
if you can bear to hear the truth youve spoken
twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools
or watch the things you gave your life to broken
and stoop and build em up with worn out tools
if you can make one heap of all your winnings
and risk it on one turn of pitch and toss
and lose and start again at your beginnings
and never breathe a word about your loss
if you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
to serve your turn long after they are gone
and so hold on when there is nothing in you
except the will which says to them hold on
if you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue
or walk with kings nor lose the common touch
if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you
if all men count with you but none too much
if you can fill the unforgiving minute
with sixty seconds worth of distance run
yours is the earth and everything thats in it
and which is more youll be a man my son
for all we have and are
for all our childrens fate
stand up and take the war
the Hun is at the gate
our world has passed away
in wantonness o'erthrown
there is nothing left to-day
but steel and fire and stone
though all we knew depart
the old commandments stand
in courage kept your heart
in strength lift up your hand
once more we hear the word
that sickened earth of old
no law except the sword
unsheathed and uncontrolled
once more it knits mankind
once more the nations go
to meet and break and bind
a crazed and driven foe
comfort content delight
the ages slow bought gain
they shrivelled in a night
only ourselves remain
to face the naked days
in silent fortitude,
through perils and dismays
renewed and re-renewed.
though all we made depart
the old commandments stand
in patience keep your heart
in strength lift up your hand
no easy hope or lies
shall bring us to our goal
but iron sacrifice
of body will and soul
there is but one task for all
one life for each to give
what stands if freedom fall
who dies if England live
